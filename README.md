## Description
Bridge your DCC model railroad to a microcontroller on a breadboard:

- Output: DCC signal for decoding (33k resistor)
- Input: DCC-ACK encoding to rails (60mA load)
- Input: RailCom encoding to rails (30mA current source)
- Power source (1): +5V 
- Power source (2): Recified railroad power

Built as breadboard friedly as possible.
